 - My Goal is to observe the fields of work and professions of Mathematicians who got prestigious medals and Awards in their respective fields.
 - Many Mathematicians were mathematicians by profession and some were professors. All the mathematicians who got Field medals are mathematicians and Professors by profession and their major fields were Topology, Algebra and Number theory.
 - We can say that there will be something in the data that can be understood even in cases of missingness. 
 - Here, there is no possibility of imputing because the data can't be replaced by mean or mode, because the data for those mathematicians was unknown. In such cases we can't ignore the data, we should be able to analyse for those the data is present. In that way we may get some information regarding the data.
